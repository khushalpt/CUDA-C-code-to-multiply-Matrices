# CUDA-C-code-to-multiply-Matrices
CUDA C based codes to conduct the following multiple matrix muliplication operations. Given N matrixes A1;    ;AN, and ONE matrix B, the N matrixes C1;    ;CN could be obtained by the following equations.
where A1;    ;AN have the same shape, and the matrixes A and B are randomly generated.

Please run your codes under the following three conditions. i) A1;    ;AN 2 R500500, B 2 R500400;N = 100; ii) A1;    ;AN 2 R5020, B 2 R2050;N = 5000; iii) A1;    ;AN 2 R64000, B 2 R40009;N = 1000;
